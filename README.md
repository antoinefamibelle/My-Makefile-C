# My-Makefile-C
This is the makefile that I often use for C project

You can compile any C project (Compile with gcc)

HOW TO USE IT :

make = Compile only the file who has been modify since the last make

make re = Compile the whole project

make clean / fclean = Clean the folder of the project by deleting all undesirable files as .o or executable
